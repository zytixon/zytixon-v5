# zytixon
The undone new version of Zytixon, which is now open-source if someone wants to do something with it. Don't get too excited though, we barely have a working login/register.

This is just your regular php/mysql thing, install it on a web server as you would do with any other php/mysql thing. A database dump is also included so you can make the thing work, which you should import to your database.
